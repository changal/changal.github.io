        <h1><strong>Livingston High School Celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month with Evening of Festivities</strong></h1>
        <h3>OCTOBER 12, 2015</h3><br/>
<p>Over 200 students, parents, and community members filled Livingston High School on Friday, October 9th, 2015 for "Hispanic Heritage Night." The evening celebration honored Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from September 15th to October 15th and recognizes the culture, communities, and contributions of Hispanics and Latinos.</p>

<p>"On a Friday night, you'd expect teenagers to be hanging out at their friends' houses or at sports activities, so it was very special for them to come to school to honor a language and culture that brings everyone together," said Susana Fernández-Poyatos, advisor of the school's Spanish Honor Society, which hosted the event.</p>

<p>The festivities included performances, prizes, and a dinner of homemade Spanish food. Entertainment throughout the night ranged from instrumental pieces to games audience members participated in through their smartphones. Many of these acts were presented by groups from the AP Spanish class at the high school, drawing inspiration from the cultural components emphasized throughout Livingston's World Languages programs.</p>

<p>"The celebration was <i>fantástica</i>: the performances were touching and hilarious, and I of course loved the variety of Hispanic food, all <i>muy delicioso,</i>" said Adam Chang, co-president of the Spanish Honor Society. Spanish cuisine offered involved both sweet and savory dishes, from the classics—<i>churros</i> and <i>empanadas</i>—to more unique creations, like <i>ceviche</i> and <i>cassava cake</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most exciting shows were two dances, one by a student group and the other by Livingston mom Sara Cabral-Fogarty. Much of the attention was also captured by two highly-engrossing albeit unusual contests, brainstormed by honor society officer Justin Gelman and co-president Lara Goldstein: Spanish karaoke and Chipotle-eating. The best performers were rewarded with gift cards to a local Mexican fusion restaurant.</p>

<p>"It was a really well-done evening, and I'm so thankful Livingston High School could offer this opportunity to reflect on the importance of Hispanic heritage in our community," said junior Vivian Lee, a candidate for induction into the honor society this year.</p>

<p>"Super enjoyable," added Garrett Meinhardt, the Spanish Honor Society's secretary, "and not just because I won the Chipotle-eating contest."</p>
